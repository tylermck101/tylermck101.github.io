        <p>I am a 4th year at Northeastern University pursuing a combined major in Computer Science and Sociology. Iâ€™m originally from Rochester, New York, and I have two cats, Arthur and Milo. My interests include Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), particularly their intersection with the world, especially in regard to race.</p>
