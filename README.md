## Description of styling 
I have three pages, the home page, about me page, and projects page. I kept a consistent theme of forest green between all three pages, with white and black accents. I also chose a custom font from google fonts, 'Playfair Display'. On the home page, I centered the title (which is my name), and the sub title contains links to the two other pages. In projects, I made the background of the text white so it is easier to white, but the background of the page green to keep it consistent with the home page. I also added a small light green border in between the two because I thought it would look nice. I did the same for the about page. For the project page, the title of each project is the header and the /p/ elements are the descriptions, i also added links to each project you can click and also highlight when you hover over them. The about page includes a title (About) and my headshot, which I made a circle. The /p/text includes a short description about me and my interests.
